# TMDB Movie App
This is a simple React application that fetches and displays popular movies using the TMDB (The Movie Database) API.

Users can:
- View a list of trending/popular movies
- Search for movies by title
- Filter movies by genre
- - Add or remove movies from a personal watchlist (stored locally in the browser)

The project demonstrates API integration, dynamic filtering, search functionality, and component-based UI using React.
